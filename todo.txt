- means that it is not yet done

-check if their neighbor checking is faster
-store the MapLocation of the robot rather than accessing it every time, its 1 byteCode cheaper
---constants in for rallypoint etc rather than 6 or 7
---use team memory, store round number, what we lsot to (HQ dead or nuke) (if our
---add a bit to our broadcast so we know we know it's ours
-have scout count people once he has vision
---better generator supplier choosing
---scouts turn into army if their army is closer to hq
---if we cant spawn, research
---people in back mining in front
---optimize code fewer bytecodes
---fix encampment people getting caught trying to get an encampment but cant pathfind there
---dont rally to HQ if medbay is dead
---if there are enemy mines blocking you, just defuse them, they're likely all around the HQ
fix the replay vs swarm-randomly going to 0,0
challenge them on team B
---single minded encampment guys, they never go out of that state
attack trigger, getting close to round 2000 and our health is lower than theirs
if medbay guy dies on way there, the medbay is lost forever, fix that
defuse enemy mines randomly every once in awhile in battle, dont touch neutral mines still while in battle
improve micro
make miners not step on mines
-if there are people at HQ come back
-function to check what our max number of robots is
-clear mines ahead of time
-make arc (this is bad though :( ) 
check IDS to see whether they are making units
number of suppliers should be a function of rush distance, number of encampments, how close they are to us
don't defuse mines if you see enemies
retreat to medbay if low on health
miners run away if they see enemy
nukes that are almost finished should jsut finish
we die to player that just rallies on small maps
people just waiting to make encampments if they see an enemy they turn into army
retake lost encampments
fix nuke sensing
refactoring code
radio fix, redundancy
-HQ checks at beginning of turn, if no power don't spawn guys, research (this can be improved
-see enemy, split into two groups each group moves back diagonally then attacks
broadcast line splitting the big group then people on right of line go one way people on left of line split other way
-try out shields then dont care about neutral mines, only care about micro
-if you just search for their radio channels for the entire first game then store it for the next game you can usually just win by fucking up their radio channels depending on how detailed their redundancy system is (interesting but not that good probably)
HQShould check if there is a medbay and if there isn't changes the radio
-see if we should stop researching, making encampments, just make guys based on scout
make sure shit doesnt go in the corner when medbay dies
other stuff
-keep track of whether we have upgrades ourselves
-possibly bitshift instead of multiplying for heighth and width because we do it a lot (if more efficient)
